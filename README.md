# HackYSU Mesh Radio Network

# Project Overview
  - This Project is our submission for the 36-hour HackYSU 2019 hackathon event.
  - Using Arduino Nano, and nRF24 radio we created what is essentially a "Walkie-Talkie" network, but for typed messages instead.
  - Allows you to type messages across a channel, which other users can see.
